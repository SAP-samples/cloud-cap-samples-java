   * Checking Logistics DocumentsThe system checks whether the invoice documents have already been entered in the Logistics invoice verification. For this, the system checks invoices that have been held or parked or that contain errors, or invoices that were entered for invoice verification in the background. The check is performed only if you specify the reference document number when you enter the invoices.When checking for duplicate invoices, the system compares the following specified characteristics:VendorCurrencyCompany CodeGross Invoice AmountReference Document NumberInvoice Document DateIf all of these characteristics are the same, the system issues a message for which you can change the message type in Customizing.When you enter credit memos or subsequent adjustments, the system does not check for duplicate invoices.Exception: The exception is the Argentina country version, where the system checks for duplicate invoices and credit memos.No message is issued if you enter a document that has previously been reversed.In Customizing for Logistics Invoice Verification under Incoming Invoice -> Set Check for Duplicate Invoices, you can specify that the following characteristics are not checked:Reference Document NumberInvoice Document DateCompany CodeHaving fewer attributes to check increases the likelihood that the system will find a duplicate invoice.Example:The following document has already been entered and posted:Reference Document Number 333Invoice Date: 4/28/2000Gross Invoice Amount 100.00Currency: EURVendor: SpencerCompany Code: ChicagoYou have set up the check for duplicate invoices as follows in Customizing:The characteristics Reference Document Number and Company Code are not activated. Consequently, these characteristics are not checked.Now you enter the following invoice:Reference Document Number 334Invoice Date: 4/28/2000Gross Invoice Amount 100.00Currency: EURVendor: SpencerCompany Code: FlagstaffResultBecause you entered a reference document when you entered the invoice, the system checks for duplicate invoices. Compared against the invoice entered earlier, the invoice just entered has different values in the characteristics Reference and Company Code. However, these characteristics are not checked due to the settings that you have made in Customizing. All other characteristics are the same. The system issues a message telling you that an invoice has been entered twice.If the characteristic &quot;Reference Document Number&quot; had been selected in Customizing, the system would have checked the reference document number and established that it was different from the invoice entered earlier, and it consequently would not have issued a message.Checking FI DocumentsThe system checks whether there are FI documents that were posted or parked with the Logistics invoice verification or with an FI invoice transaction. Depending on the entry in the Reference field, one of the following checks is performed:If a reference number was specified in the sequential invoice/credit memo, the system checks whether an invoice/credit memo has already been posted for which all the following attributes agree:Company CodeVendorCurrencyDocument DateReference NumberIf no reference number was specified in the sequential invoice/credit memo, the system checks whether an invoice/credit memo has already been posted for which all the following attributes agree:Company CodeVendorCurrencyDocument DateAmount in Document CurrencyIn Materials Management, the system applies the check for duplicate invoices for invoices only, not for credit memos.

   * Withholding tax types classify particular features of a withholding tax including:The time at which the withholding tax is postedThe basis on which the base amount is calculatedThe basis for accumulation (if applicable)Withholding tax types are to be distinguished from withholding tax codes, to which are allocated the withholding tax percentage rate example.Whether a withholding tax can be defined as an existing type by means of a new code, or if a new type needs to be defined will depend on the type of transaction (see below).Note that a business transaction can only be assigned one withholding tax code per withholding tax type. If the business transaction is subject to several withholding taxes simultaneously, these must be represented by different types.This is the case in Argentina for example, where up to four kinds of withholding tax per business transaction are possible.
