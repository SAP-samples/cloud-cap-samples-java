# Overview

This sample application shows how to conveniently create business applications based on **CDS domain models**, persisting data with **SQLite**, or **SAP HANA**, and exposing an **OData V4** frontend with an **SAP Fiori** frontend on top.

This sample uses Spring Boot as an **application framework**. Although a CAP Java application isn’t required to build on Spring Boot, it’s the first choice of framework, as it’s seamlessly integrated.

The **domain models** are defined using [CDS entity definitions](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#entity-and-type-definitions).

By default, an in-memory or optionally a file-based SQLite database is used for **data persistency**. Once productively deployed to SAP Cloud Platform, SAP HANA can be used.

**Services** are defined using [CDS Service Models](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#services). The **OData V4 Protocol Adapter** translates the CDS service models into corresponding OData schemas and maps the incoming OData requests to the corresponding CDS services.

Although CAP provides generic **event handlers** to serve most CRUD requests out-of-the-box, it’s possible to add business logic through [Custom Event Handlers](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/in-a-nutshell#adding-custom-logic).

A Fiori UI is added using predefined SAP Fiori elements templates. **[Fiori annotations](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/fiori/#fiori-annotations)** add information to the service definitions, on how to render the data.

# Getting Started

The following sections describe how to set up, build, and run the project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have set up a development environment (that means, you’ve installed the CDS Compiler, Java, and Apache Maven) [as described here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/getting-started).

## Clone Build & Run

1.  Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples-java.git
```

2. Build and run the application:

```
  mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Using Eclipse

Optionally, use the following steps to import the project to Eclipse:

1.  Import the project using **File > Import > Existing Maven Projects**.

    Now, you should see the projects **bookshop** and **bookshop-parent** in the project/package explorer view.

2.  In Project Explorer, change the property "Package Presentation" from "Flat" to "Hierarchical" for better understanding.


### Building and Running

1.  To **compile** the project, right-click the file `pom.xml` in the `bookshop-parent` project root folder and select
**Run as** > **Maven build**.

    In the following dialog, enter the string `clean install` into the field labeled with "Goals" and click "Run".

    Note: This step also compiles the CDS artifacts, thus repeat this once you made changes to the CDS model. This step also generates source files, therefore refresh the "bookshop" project in your IDE.

2.  To **run** the application, right-click the `bookshop` project root in the Package Explorer and select **Run as** > **Spring Boot App** (make sure you have [Spring Tools 4 installed](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/spring-tools-4-aka-spring-tool-suite-4)).

    This step creates a default Run Configuration named `Bookshop - Application` and starts the application afterwards. To go on with the next step, stop the application again.

3.  Then, set the default working directory by editing your Run Configuration via **Run** > **Run Configurations** > **Bookshop - Application**. On the tab **Arguments** change the default **Working Directory** to:

	```${workspace_loc:bookshop-parent}```

	Afterwards, click **Run**. This step starts the applications `main` method located in `src/main/java/my/bookshop/Application.java`.

4.  Use the following links in the browser to check if everything works fine:

    <http://localhost:8080/>: This should show the automatically generated index page of served paths.
    <http://localhost:8080/fiori.html>: This is the actual bookshop application UI.

    You'll start with an empty stock of books as this procedure starts the bookshop application with an empty in-memory SQLite database.

    Two mock users are defined for local development:
    - User: `user`, password: `user` to browse books
    - User: `admin`, password: `admin` to manage books and orders

## Database Setup and Spring Profiles

The application comes with three predefined profiles: `default`, `sqlite`, and `cloud` (see `srv/src/main/resources/application.yaml`).

- The `default` profile specifies to use an in-memory SQLite database.
  The in-memory database is set up automatically during startup of the application.
  However, example data from CSV files aren’t yet automatically imported, therefore some content needs to be created via OData V4 API requests.

- The `sqlite` profile specifies to use a persistent SQLite database from root directory of the project.
  This database needs to be created first, to ensure it’s initialized with the correct schema and with the CSV-based example data.
  To initialize the database, simply run `cds deploy --to sql:sqlite.db --no-save` from the project's root directory. Repeat this step, once you make changes to the CDS model.

- When deploying the application to Cloud Foundry, the CF Java Buildpack automatically configures the `cloud` Spring profile.
  This profile doesn’t specify any datasource location. In that case CAP Java can automatically detect SAP HANA service bindings available in the environment.

## Using a File-Based SQLite Database

To switch from the default in-memory SQLite database to a file-based SQLite database in this sample application, perform the following steps:

1.  Deploy the example data stored in .csv files in the folder `db/data` to a file-based SQLite database by executing the command-line utility

    ```cds deploy --to sql:sqlite.db --no-save```

    from your project root folder.

2.  Edit your Run Configuration via **Run** > **Run Configurations...** and select enter the **Profile** `sqlite` on tab **Spring** and click **Run**.

## Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform

CAP Java applications can be deployed to the SAP Cloud Platform either in single tenant or in multitenancy mode. See [Multitenancy in CAP Java](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java/multitenancy) for more information.

Prerequisites:
- Install the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/): `npm install -g mbt`.
- Install the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html).
- Get an SAP Cloud Platform account to deploy the services and applications.

Deploy as Single Tenant Application:
- Rename `mta-single-tenant.yaml` to `mta.yaml`
- Run `mbt build`
- Run `cf login`
- Run `cf deploy mta_archives/bookshop-java-public_1.0.0.mtar`

Deploy as Multitenant Application:
- Create an SAP HANA Cloud Instance in your SAP Cloud Platform space.
- Rename `mta-multi-tenant.yaml` to `mta.yaml`
- Run `mbt build`
- Run `cf login`
- Run `cf deploy mta_archives/bookshop-java-public_1.0.0.mtar`
- Go to another subaccount in your global account, under subscriptions and subscribe to the application you deployed.
- Run `cf map-route bookshop-java-public-approuter <YOUR DOMAIN> --hostname <SUBSCRIBER TENANT>-<ORG>-<SPACE>-bookshop-java-public-approuter` or create and bind the route manually.
